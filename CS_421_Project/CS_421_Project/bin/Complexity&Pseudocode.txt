PSEUDOCODE:

FUNCTION main

	create new scanner																1
	ask user to enter the file directory path										1
	
	TRY
		read the file into string by line											n
		create new file																1
		create new scanner from the new file										1
		create new ArrayList as holder array										1
		
		WHILE(file has more ints)													n
			create temp int to store next int										n
			insert temp into ArrayList												n	
		
		close files																	2
		
		create new int index and set to 0											1
		create new int vertices and set to ArrayList at index 0						1
		
		create new vertices matrix/2d array with lengths of vertices variable		1
		FOR(0 to vertices value - 1)												n
			FOR(0 to vertices value - 1)											n^2
				set matrix index value to ArrayList at index+1						n^2
				increase index value by 1											n^2

			if matrix at current index does not equal 0								n
				set simple graph to false											n
				
		FOR(0 to vertices value - 1)												n	
			FOR(0 to vertices value - 1)											n^2
				if matrix at current index is greater than 1						n^2
					set simple graph to false										n^2
		
		print result of simple graph determination									1
		
	CATCH
		exception handling print statement if file does not exist					1

END main

COMPLEXITY:

input size of file is n so:

g(m) = n

f(n) = 6n^2 + 9n + 13

h(m) = (f o g)(m) = f(g(m)) = 6(n)^2 + 9(n) + 13 = 6n^2 + 9n + 13
